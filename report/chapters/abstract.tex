  \vspace{0.5cm}
  This report covers the design and implementation of an Occam compiler, as well
  as a distributed runtime system and the corresponding language extension which
  allows programs to execute on an arbitrarily large collection of worker
  machines. The project is implemented in portable C++ and successfully compiles
  and runs on both x86 and ARM platforms.
