  Things to mention:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The na\"ive grammar for expression parsing results in exponentially many
      parse trees to be explored when the code contains a syntax error. This is
      solved by factorising the grammar.
    \item
      Intricacies of variable-length instructions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item
          Instruction to be encoded affects how long the encoded instruction is.
        \item
          The length of the encoded instruction can affect what instruction
          should be encoded.
        \item
          This circular dependency can be solved by iteration until a fixed
          point is found.
        \item
          Forward jump which lies near the boundary between two different
          instruction lengths are a pain.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
