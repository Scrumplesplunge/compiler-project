# Compiling a CSP-like language

This is the repository for the project that I have undertaken during the fourth
year of my undergraduate Masters course at the University of Oxford. The
contents of this repository is as follows:

### Occam 1 Compiler

The compiler is written in Haskell, and targets the
[Transputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transputer) instruction set. See the
compiler directory for the status of the compiler.

### Virtual Machine

Since the transputer is not exactly as widespread as INMOS would have liked, the
vm directory includes the source code for a virtual machine which emulates the
transputer instruction set. See this directory for the status of the virtual
machine.

### Project Report

A detailed overview of the project can be found in the report directory.
